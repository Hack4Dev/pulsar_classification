# Pulsars Classification

## Description

Welcome to the project on pulsars classification! you will build a machine learning classifier to separate out real astronomical signals from man-made radio frequency interference (RFI); From the tutorials you will learn the following:

- *Tutorial 1* :  The classification of pulsars 

## Data

A csv file that contains a summary statistes of 1D line graphs.

## Hackathon Task

From the proposed pipeline (tutorials), investigate new ways to classify between pulsars and RFI signals

## Prerequisites

All the libraries/dependencies necessary to run the tutorials are listed in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/pulsar_classification/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.


## Installation

All the required libraries can be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Hack4Dev/pulsar_classification/blob/master/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Would you like to clone this repository? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Hack4Dev/pulsar_classification.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. 


### New to Github?

The easiest way to get all of the lecture and tutorial material is to clone this repository. To do this you need git installed on your laptop. If you're working on Linux you can install git using apt-get (you might need to use sudo):

```
apt install git
```

You can then clone the repository by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Hack4Dev/pulsar_classification.git
```

To update your clone if changes are made, use:

```
cd pulsar_classification/
git pull
```
